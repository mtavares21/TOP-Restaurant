Restaurant page built mostly with js modules and webpack

##Objectives
- Learn the basics of Webpack;
- Use only JS Modules to set up the page.

##About

I've just started using Webpack, i'am already hooked, really cool program to work with, 
and seems a real time saver for bigger projects. I can only imagine of it was to bundle
up a project from 10 developers without this kind of tool!

I still got to understand how to add Google Fonts to the project with Webpack. There's
documentation refering to this for font files in the file directory, but, at first, 
nothing about connecting fonts with JS. Something to discover in time for the next project,
or simply use a css file.

The biggest challenge here was to make good, organized, modular code. So basically i've,
done a sketch of the site and them refactor everything more orderly, with good syntax and
no repetition.

I used mainly Factory Functions, i tested out the Classes, then the Factory Functions and IIFE,
and just left it like that. Honestly i think im more of fan of the functional aproach, but still
to much of a newbie to say it for sure.
Just seems that the Functional aprouch does everything a Classe does but in a more direct way,
not so prone to possible errors.

The  desing could be a LOT better, but it's good enough for now.
